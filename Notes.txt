
Execution

serial_radar.exe


Parameters

--mqtt (mqtt broker)
--mqtt_port (broker port) 1883 default
--mqtt_topic (topic for use at the beginning of all topics)
--commport (port for communication with the device)


Example

serial_radar.exe --mqtt tcp://localhost --mqtt_topic test/radar1/ --commport 7


Keyboard commands

text can be input for a description of a log entry  
"return" adds an entry to a "listprint.txt" file with the description and most current target data.

"-" stops execution and exits


Config file

A configuration file "config.conf" is created which contains default values obtained from the device. After its creation it	
		can be modified through the web interface.

These are not configurable (description only)
    "DeviceAddress": - device address of the unit (always 100 for the 5010)
    "DeviceName": "iSYS-5010_0000011371",
    "DspHardwareVersion": "2:1",
     "ProductInfo": "5010",
    "RfeHardwareVersion": "2:1",
    "SerialNumber": "11371",
	
Server configuration 
	
    "comport": (COMx for the 5010) (should show as "Prolific USB-to-Serial Comm Port (COMx)
    "mqttbroker": (broker location) 'tcp://' + address
    "mqttclient": (broker client name)
    "mqttpassword": (broker password)
    "mqttport": "1883", (port used by the broker) -- 1883 default 
    "mqtttopic": "test/radar1/", (top level topic -- usually a unique id from a public broker)
    "notify": "10", (update rate of the MQTT messages)  
	
Sensor configuration
	
	"Angle" - angle configured for the unit
    "FrequencyChannel": "2",
    "x": "0.0", (x location of the unit)
    "y": "0.0" (y location of the unit)


	
MQTT Topics
	"mqtttopic"/targets

	
MQTT JSON entries (targets)
	
		"x" - x coordinate (calculated by the range and angle of the target)
		"y" - y coordinate (calculated by the range and angle of the target)
		"r" - range reported by the unit
		"a" - angle of the target reported by the unit
		"v" - velocity of the target reported by the unit
		"time" - time stamp when the message was created
			

Web interface "localhost:8081/example"

	- Parameters for the server and the sensor are accessible through the interface
	- Control of acquisition of target data from the sensor. (Start/Stop)
	a
Notes:
- There are diagnostic messages to help in identifying issues. Mostly at the initialization and sparingly during operation.
- If there are issues with the config file(shouldn't be) it's best to delete it and start fresh. 
	The system will create a new one with default values.
- Currently targets are filtered by (range < 10 meters) && (velocity < -.01 || > .01) (only targets within 10 meters that 
	are moving will be sent).
- A diagnostic message may appear occasionally indicating an SPI error. It's not fatal since the system will recover very quickly.
	It occurs on some messages which don't follow the spec. If it does starts occurring frequently there may be a problem with the
	device or the notify cycle is too short. The time can be extended using the web interface.
- The radar unit is configured to use clustering. This feature allows multiple targets within a small area to generate only one
	message. It reduces the amount of extraneous messages generated when a number of objects are detected within this small area.
